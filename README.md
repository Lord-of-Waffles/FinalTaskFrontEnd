# Final Task

## This project was the final task for a front-end programming course.
## It functions as a front-end website that lets users interact with a fictional company's back-end API.
## The project was built using Vite and written mainly in React (Javascript).
## To learn something new and have a more consistent style, I used the Mantine UI component library and Tabler icons recommended in the Mantine documentation.
## The tables are built with AG Grid and are styled using their styling API. The calendar uses the React Big Calendar Component.
